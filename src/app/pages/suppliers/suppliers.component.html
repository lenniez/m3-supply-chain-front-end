      <p>Our sandal and shoe factory occupies a beautiful neo-brutalist building in Brescia, Italy. Here, 60 craftspeople work in
        a 7,685 square ft facility. Owners Paolo and Tita have overseen it for 20 years but told us that many of the employees have
        been there for more than 30.</p>
